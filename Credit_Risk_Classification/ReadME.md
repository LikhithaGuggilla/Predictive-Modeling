# Credit Risk Assessment  

## Project Overview  
This project leverages predictive modeling to **classify customers into high-risk and low-risk categories**, enabling financial institutions to make data-driven lending decisions with reduced manual effort. By applying advanced data processing and predictive modeling, we enhance risk assessment accuracy and streamline loan approval processes.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Credit Score Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification?select=train.csv)  
- **Size**: 100,000 Rows Ã— 27 Columns  
- **Target Variable**: `Credit_Score` (Categorized as Good, Standard, and Poor)  
- **Reclassified Risk Levels:**  
  - **Low Risk (1)** = Good & Standard  
  - **High Risk (0)** = Poor  

### Data Preprocessing Workflow  

- **Data Aggregation**: Monthly records were merged to create a **single-row representation per customer** to avoid bias from multiple records for the same individual.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Redundant columns (e.g., **monthly salary** when **annual income** exists) were removed.  
- **Outlier Handling**: Applied **Mahalanobis Distance** to eliminate extreme values that could distort model performance.  
- **Feature Selection**: Utilized **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **correlation analysis** to identify and retain only the **most influential features**, ultimately narrowing down the dataset to **9 key predictors**.  

### Most Important Features for Prediction  

1. **Outstanding Debt** â€“ Higher debt correlates with higher risk  
2. **Avg Delay from Due Date** â€“ Late payments indicate lower creditworthiness  
3. **Num of Credit Cards & Loans** â€“ Higher numbers suggest financial overextension  
4. **Interest Rate** â€“ Anomalies in lending risk assessment  

### Final Processed Data  

| Dataset Type | Rows | Columns |
|-------------|------|---------|
| **Raw Dataset** | 100,000 | 27 |
| **Optimized (Significant Features Only)** | 8,442 | 9 |

## Key Insights from Exploratory Data Analysis   

1. **Customers with an extensive credit history** are generally classified as **low risk**, indicating that a well-established credit track record contributes to financial stability.
   []

2. **Longer payment delays** are strongly associated with **higher credit risk**, as frequent late payments suggest **financial instability or poor repayment behavior**.
   []

3. **High-risk borrowers often receive lower interest rates**, which may indicate **inefficiencies in risk-based pricing strategies**, potentially leading to **mispriced lending decisions**.
   []

4. **The top 20% of low-risk customers are 1.7Ã— more likely to repay their loans**, highlighting the **benefits of prioritizing low-risk borrowers** in lending strategies.
